# ``Prefixed``

A type-safe, `Codable` `struct` for prefixed types

## Overview

`UUID`s are great, you can use them everywhere… but when you do so,
it starts being hard to recognize where a `UUID` comes from.

A common pattern is to add readable prefixes to the `UUID`s.
This way, you can have `user_ee505428-a17b-4935-b81c-266b81a63515`
and `post_d58a3f88-0493-458d-bd4b-a6ca4a2cc98c` for example,
making it easy to find which is which.

Writing this library, I wanted to keep it very simple and straight-forward.
I also wanted the ``PrefixedUUID``s to be type-safe, meaning a `UUID` prefixed with `user_`
could not be used instead of a `UUID` prefixed by `post_`.

After writing `PrefixedUUID`, I realized prefixed `UUID`s are just a subset
of all the types we could want to prefix. That's why I made it more generic,
by creating the ``Prefixed`` `struct`.

## Features

> These are the features of ``PrefixedUUID``s, but you can say the same with any other prefixed type.

- **Type safety:** `User.ID != Post.ID`, even though they are stored the same way
- **`Codable`:** (`Encodable & Decodable`) conformance
- **Practical:** ``PrefixedUUID``s allow you to access the underlying `UUID` or the prefixed `String`,
  without storing anything more in memory or requiring expensive computations.
- **Convenient:** Foundation's `UUID` extensions make it easy to work with ``PrefixedUUID``s
- **Type inference:** Most of the time, you don't need to make associated types explicit
- **Lightweight:** ``PrefixedUUID``s take (almost) as little space in memory as `UUID`s do.
  `String` prefixes are stored once ever and dashes in the `UUID` are not stored.
  The only thing that's stored for each ``PrefixedUUID`` is a `UUID` (which directly stores bytes).
- **Case (in)sensitive:** By default, prefixes are case sensitive, but with a simple option,
  you can choose for a prefix to be case insensitive.
- **Debugging:** Failing to decode a ``Prefixed/Prefixed`` type shows a human-readable error:
  - `"'usr_abcdef' is not prefixed by 'user_'"`
  - `"'USR_MONPQR' is not prefixed by 'user_' (case insensitive)"`
  - `"user_ABCD"` with a `Prefixed` `Int` => <code>"'ABCD' is not a valid \`Int\`"</code>
  - `"user_56C68C54"` with a `Prefixed` `UUID` => <code>"'56C68C54' is not a valid \`UUID\`"</code>

## Usage

> The following uses `PrefixedUUID`s, but you can use `Prefixed<Prefix, Base>` instead if you want.

First, create a type conforming to ``PrefixProtocol``:

```swift
struct UserIDPrefix: PrefixProtocol {
	static var prefix: String { "user_" }
}
```

If you want the prefix to be case-insensitive, you can override the default (`true`) value:

```swift
struct CaseInsensitiveUserIDPrefix: PrefixProtocol {
	static var prefix: String { "lower_user_" }
	static var isCaseSensitive: Bool { false }
}
```

Then, use your new type as you would normally do:

```swift
struct User: Codable, Identifiable {
	typealias ID = PrefixedUUID<UserIDPrefix>
	let id: ID
}
```

> `Identifiable` is not necessary, it's just here as a good practice.
> `Codable` is not necessary either, but you can use it: ``PrefixedUUID`` conforms to `Codable`.

There are many ways to create a ``PrefixedUUID``:

- Using the verbose initializer:
  
  ```swift
  let prefixedUUID = PrefixedUUID<UserIDPrefix>(uuid: UUID())
  ```
  
- Using the default value (`UUID()`):
  
  ```swift
  let prefixedUUID = PrefixedUUID<UserIDPrefix>()
  ```
  
- Using the convenient `UUID` extensions:
  
  ```swift
  let prefixedUUID = UUID().prefixed(by: UserIDPrefix.self)
  ```
  
- The compiler can infer the type of your ``PrefixProtocol``,
  so most of the time you just have to use `.prefixed()`:
  
  ```swift
  let prefixedUUID: PrefixedUUID<UserIDPrefix> = UUID().prefixed()
  ```
